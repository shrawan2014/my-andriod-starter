-


 Given a string, write a function that return if it is Palindrome. This wasn't asked directly but from interviewer example i was need to understand that this function must ignore all spaces and > 345 special symbols. 
-


 Given an array, write a function that return true if any 3 elements of this array can sum to 0. My first solution was the simplest and far from best which result in O(n^3). Then interviewer > 346 asked me to improve to improve it to O(n^2). This give me a hint that i can use Hash to reduce complexity.

> 776 What this actually means is, why do you want to change your workplace? But it’s
-


> 777 phrased in the above way, confusing the early on job seekers. You should remember not to speak about your current company or your boss badly because it has high chances of backfiring. Don’t take this chance to rant about how much you’re dissatisfied, but take the chance to explain how this interview and this opportunity is right for you.
-


Why have you changed so many jobs?
-


> 778 Hiring managers tend to break a sweat when they get candidates who have changed jobs pretty often. It’s a big decision to hire someone and involves the company’s money and time. Hence, they are > 779 skeptical about hiring someone who is fickle minded about their job choices. You need to give relevant reasons for changing over companies, during the course of time. Once they hear the reasons, they are relatively at ease.
-


What are your strengths?
-


> 780 This is a very common question, and practically every HR asks them nowadays. This question’s answer should emphasize your work experience and how it aligns with the company’s mission, and also > 781 your long-term career goals. You can’t mention a basketball player or a dessert chef as your strength—however good you may be at it. You need to jot down your professional strengths using examples, like for instance, handling the team when it has disparities and getting them to arrive at one decision, seems much better than saying you’re a team player.
-


What are your weaknesses?
-


> 782 Now, you might think how can you reveal your weakness, give yourself away and lose major brownie points for it. You need to be smart about this. You need not literally share what you actually > 783 believe is your weakness (unless you decide honesty is the best policy, and you’re improving on it), but something that is light and not very serious, and revolving around your job profile. For instance, I can be too diplomatic to people whom I manage, I can be a little too ambitious with allotting work to subordinates, etc.
-


> 784 What’s your greatest achievement?
-


> 785 Now, again this talks about professional achievement. Seeing these statistics may help the recruiter focus on how you will benefit the company he will hire you into. Make sure you have 1-2 pointers about your achievements with numbers to support them. While it’s advised to not go very deep into it, but be thorough about what you’re saying.
-


What about the time you disagreed or had a spat with a colleague? How did you handle?
-


> 786 This is you being thrown into a situation. It might not have happened to you, but using a hypothetical situation, they test your thought process and maturity regarding handling the situation, and > 787 the willingness to work together even if you’re at loggerheads with that person. Your response to this question will give away a lot of information about yourself, so be prudent enough and design a good response (and of course, act on it when the time comes).
-


Can you deal with pressure/stress?
-


Obviously, for achieving that job, you might even say yes. But introspect well, and answer. The hiring manager checks if you have the competence and willingness to handle a high-pressure job or > 788 tough and stressful situations (maybe because the job profile requires someone like that). If yes, then convince them by saying you applied to this job knowing what it incurs. Being honest is > 789 very important here. Remember, this will just give you a heads-up about what is going to be asked (high chances, at least). If you prepare the above questions, it is going to boost your confidence and you’ll sound like you are sure about yourself in the interview!
